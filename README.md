# Weather App 

## AUTHOR

Edward Reyes

## CONCEPT
This app uses express.js to get and post notes to a json file, allowing users to add, save, and delete notes.

## Process    
  ### Back End Development
  * I used the Open Weather Api as required by this assignment. I used the Current Weather API,
    5-day forecast API, and the current UV Index API in order to get the required data.
  * I used both vanilla javascript, ES6 syntax, jQuery, and Ajax calls to both work with
    the API and display HTML elements, information, button interactions dynamically.

### Technologies used:  
  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, OpenWeather API, jQuery

## CHALLENGES
  * Mostly working with the layout. This time I did a mobile-first approach which  I wasn't used to.
  * Also keeping the script.js file organzied and not too crowded, while also working one keeping 
    the code overall non-repetitive or D.R.Y.
